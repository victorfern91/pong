# PONG (HTML5 + Ecmascript 6) game
### State: Under Development
This is my first game based in HTML5 (using canvas) and ECMAScript 6. Dependency: **Node.js**.
## Install dependencies
Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/).
After have the Node.js installed in your machine, run this command:
```sh
$ npm install
```
## Build Pong game
As the actual browsers don't support the new version of the javascript, it is necessary to use a procedure to "compile" the ECMAscript 6 code to the version of javascript which browsers use. So, after install the dependencies run the following command, in order to "compile" code:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
## Play pong
```sh
$ npm start
```
Go to chrome/firefox/safari/etc and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
## Any question?
